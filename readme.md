# linguini NeoVim Config

## Fonts
In order to have the correct font, install the [JetBrains Mono Nerd Font](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads)
from nerdfonts.

Disable ligatures in the terminal's font settings using `font.features.calt = 0` within the `settings.json` file
for the Windows terminal. This should be done under the default profiles.

## Terminal Colours
The terminal colours are recommended to match this config's theme, **gruvbox**, for best results.

## Compiler
The Clang compiler is required in order to compile some dependencies of this config.
